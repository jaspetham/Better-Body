# What i use?

I have made the website with Bootstrap 4 Framework, Little bit of Jquery and some Font awesome icon.

## Suggest Improvement

1. Improve User interface- In my recreated website, i have added an icon hover effect for the button and the navbar underline effect plus the scrollspy effect. I've also a new color background
2. Content Arrangement - in the old website, all of the content is spread out and is confusing so i added more section of the website to be more specific and change the content placement to be more presentable
3. Improve the card - In my recreated website of the ingredient, 30/90/60 days supply card added a hover effect and shadow effect.
4. Improve FAQ - In my recreated website, i have rework the accordion to look more presentable.
5. Improve Footer - The footer of the old website is too long and not symmetrical so i improve the footer with grid system
